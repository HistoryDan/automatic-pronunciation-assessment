## Introduction üòÅ
### Q) Why are we doing this?
- We all know how the communication skill is important. Also, education for children will affect the next generation. After the pandemic, the alpha(Œ±) generation is facing the problem of lack of language skills. They have learned language through passive digital media such as YouTube instead of direct interactions. For these children, adults have to support to improve their language skill enough, but double-income family is universal especially in Korea, which makes it difficult to count on individual family member to educate their child.

- Many families send children to academies for English education, but nonetheless, academies often focus on grammar and university enrollment exams rather than children's pronunciation and speaking skills.

### A) Speaking practice service for children with AI speaker NUGU
- There is a market gap for active 'speaking' education for the alpha generation.
- Due to the characteristics of AI speakers, it can be used for educational purposes even in households where smartphone usage is restricted.
- Measuring a child's pronunciation skills through simple quizzes: Using the NUGU AI Speaker, we provide some simple quizzes to encourage a child to speak. Then, we provide parents with an **analysis report of the child's pronunciation** compared to normal pronunciation through deep learning techniques. This service will help develop the child's language skills in an untact environment. In addition, it **tracks the child's language development**, giving parents a comprehensive understanding of the child's language skills. (For a detailed description of the service, please refer to the `presentation.pdf` file in the `others` folder)
